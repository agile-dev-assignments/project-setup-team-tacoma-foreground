# Guide to Contributing
Delete the contents of this file and replace with the contents of a proper guide to contributing to this project, as described in the [instructions](./instructions.md)


Each team must collaboratively draft a [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) - a Markdown document exclusively dedicated to how others can contribute to this project.  This document is essentially a contract agreed-upon by all developers and contributors, and includes at a minimum:
- the project's values and team norms, including the definition of "done"

## Project values and team norms

### Definition of 'done':
- Acceptance criteria met (for a user story).
- Code/feature is peer reviewed. 
- Code/feature is proofread. 
- Code/feature is deployed to the test branch and runs successfully with the existing codebase - new increment doesn't compromise existing . 
- Code/feature passes testing if there are any testing requirements specified. 
- Code/feature 

define a definition of “done” appropriate for the product. If there are multiple Scrum Teams
working on the system or product release, the development teams on all of the Scrum Teams
must mutually define the definition of “Done.”
Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly tested, ensuring that all
Increments work together.

### Definition of 'done' for a non-coding project:
- Acceptance criteria met (for a user story)
- Code/feature is peer reviewed
- Code/feature is deployed to the test branch and rns
- Code/feature passes testing if there are any testing requirements 

2. if the task is not coding related, it is 'done' if: 
- Output (e.g. text/wireframes) has been peer reviewed
- Output has been deployed 
- If the task was to learn/research a tool, a brief summary of the learnt knowledge is given

Code is documented
Help documentation is updated
Feature is OK’d by stakeholder


2. if the task is a  update, it is 'done' if the update has been tested in the 'test branch'

### the Git workflow that the team follows

- a detailed description of the rules of contributing and any considerations or how and what to contribute
- how disagreements or conflicts among team members will be resolved
- instructions for setting up the local development environment in order to work on this project
- instructions for building and testing the project (update with that information once the project reaches that stage)

This documents allows potential contributors, whether in the open source community or in a private organization, to see the project's rules and processes for contributions. It should be well-formatted with clear headings and subheadings.  

GitHub provides a link to this document automatically to any user who creates a Pull Request on this project.
